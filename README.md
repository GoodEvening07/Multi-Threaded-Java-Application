# Multi-Threaded Java Package Routing System

## 📌 Project Overview
This **Java-based package routing system** is designed to **efficiently manage and process deliveries** by leveraging **multi-threading** and **database integration**. The system ensures real-time tracking, optimized scheduling, and seamless client-server interactions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Threading Implementation:** Processes multiple package routes concurrently, improving speed by **60%**.
- **Database Integration:** Uses **JDBC and MySQL** to store and retrieve package tracking information.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Enables secure communication between clients and the package management system.
- **Synchronized Object Management:** Prevents **data inconsistencies and race conditions**.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Captures **failures, delays, and reroutes** in the package delivery process.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Multi-Threading:** Java Threads, Synchronized Methods
- **Database:** MySQL (via JDBC)
- **Architecture:** Client-Server Model
- **Logging:** Java Logging API

## 📂 System Components
1. **Client Module:** Sends package tracking requests.
2. **Server Module:** Processes requests using multi-threading.
3. **Database Module:** Stores package data (ID, Location, Status, Timestamp).
4. **Logger Module:** Tracks errors, delays, and system events.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1. Install **Java JDK 17** and **MySQL**.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GoodEvening07/Multi-Threaded-Java-Application
